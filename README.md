# Current Progress
This project revolves around learning NumPy through using my already established knowledge from MATLAB and applying it to python specifically through this library. I try to create a program that can perform LU Decomposition and return a solution to the system of equations for any system.

Through the creation of this file, I learnt the basic of NumPy through various documentation along with applying my skills from MATLAB to achieve the results. At the moment, this program is not complete as there are some bugs with regards to the final answer that I will fix after midterms. This will further develop my understanding of thinking about how to fix the specific bugs that are causing the wrong output.

Regardless, thanks for looking at this project and hope you have a beautiful day!
